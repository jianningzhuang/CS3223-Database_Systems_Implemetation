# Database Systems Implemetation

This system-oriented course provides an in-depth study of the concepts and implementation issues related to database management systems. It first covers the physical implementation of the relational data model, which includes storage management, access methods, query processing, and optimisation. Then it covers issues and techniques dealing with multi-user application environments, namely, transactions, concurrency control, and recovery. The third part covers advanced topics such as on-line analytical processing, in-memory databases, and column stores.
